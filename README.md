# MuStream

design ideas
- add multiple dir that are scanned when updatedb 
- allow file uploads (have no idea when someone will use this lol)
- allow deletion of tracks/albums/genres/artist/user (confirm + retype password)
- editing of database will change the orgianal file?


- each user
	- has a list of dirs to scan
	- has a list of albums + artists + tracks + genres + playlists (able to view and play from each)
		- play from album/artist/all tracks/genre/playlist (shuffle on/off)
	- keep history in session at least
	- ? keep history in db ?
	- keep shuffle on/off in db
	- 
	

apps
